    <!-- Simple Omelette Recipe An easy and quick dish, perfect for any meal. This
    classic omelette combines beaten eggs cooked to perfection, optionally
    filled with your choice of cheese, vegetables, or meats. Preparation time
    Total: Approximately 10 minutes Preparation: 5 minutes Cooking: 5 minutes
    Ingredients 2-3 large eggs Salt, to taste Pepper, to taste 1 tablespoon of
    butter or oil Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats,
    herbs Instructions Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of
    salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water
    or milk for a fluffier texture. Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan
    over medium heat and add butter or oil. Cook the omelette: Once the butter
    is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs
    evenly coat the surface. Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set
    at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your
    chosen fillings over one half of the omelette. Fold and serve: As the
    omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the
    fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate. Enjoy:
    Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed. Nutrition The table
    below shows nutritional values per serving without the additional fillings.
